A mmorpg, building with jMonkeyEngine, Blender and MakeHuman.

The project intends to be a free mmorpg. The goal is to learn about making a mmorpg and have lots of fun. So, don't expect to
find experts programmers here, you will probably just meet a group of people studying and making experiments on how to implement cool game stuff
and improving the code. If this is enough for you, it shall certainly be for us. Welcome aboard, you may contact us here if you wish, but be warned, there
are no commitments on deadlines to answering requests, doubts, and all.
