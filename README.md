A mmorpg, building with jMonkeyEngine, Blender and MakeHuman.

The project intends to be a free mmorpg. The goal is to learn about making a mmorpg having fun. So, don't expect to
find experts code here, just expect to meet a group of people studying and making experiments on how to implement stuff
and improving the code. If it is enough for you, it ewill be for us. Welcome aboard, if you wish contact us, but, there
is no commitments on deadlines to answering requests, doubts, and all.
